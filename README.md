# LessonPlan

## Introduction

LessonPlan is a full-stack application that enables music teachers to prepare individualized lesson plans for students and keep track of their students' progress.

## Homepage

On the homepage existing users can log into the site, or sign up for the site by providing their e-mail and a password.

## Student Dashboard

After loggin in, teachers are directed to their student dashboard, where they can start adding profiles for their students. Teachers who already have accounts see all of their current students on the dashboard. 

When teachers click on a student's profile, they are directed to the student profile where they can see information about that student such as the student's name, e-mail, instrumen, and a list of songs they are working on. 

## Song Pages

When a teacher clicks on a specific song, they are directed to a song page with information about the song's name. In future versions I hope to include a feature to upload sheet music for the song using a filesystem and a link to audio for the song. 

## Technologies Used

Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, EJS, CSS Grid
