# LessonPlan

## Introduction

LessonPlan is a full-stack application that enables music teachers to prepare individualized lesson plans for students and keep track of their students' progress.

When teachers sign up for the website, they are directed to their student dashboard, where they can start adding profiles for students they are currently teaching. Teachers who already have accounts can log in and will see all of their current students listed on the dashboard. 

When they click on a student's profile, they are directed to the student's profile page where they can see information about that student such as the student's name, e-mail, instrumen, and a list of songs they are working on. 

When a teacher clicks on a specific song, they are directed to a song page with information about the song's name. In future versions I hope to include a feature to upload sheet music for the song using a filesystem and a link to audio for the song.
